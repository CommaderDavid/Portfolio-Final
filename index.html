    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is David Boedigheimer. I am 24 years old, and an avid student of coding and animation. I became <em>fixated</em> on animation back in highschool. Around the same time, I became an avid gamer. When I graduated with honors, I picked out Mt. Hood community college and got my associates degree in <strong>Video Game Design</strong>. While I learned a lot, I did not learn as <strong>much</strong> coding as I <em>wish</em> I could have.  Since then, I have been looking on how to <strong>improve</strong> my skill in coding. I discovered <strong>Fidgetech</strong> and then <strong>Epicodus</strong>. <em>Thus</em>, here I am.</p>
